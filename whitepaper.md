Project Scope 

 

Describe the project in detail. How will the project benefit the ICP ecosystem? 

The "ICP in the DMV" project aims to significantly enhance the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem by hosting events that will educate and engage the web development community in Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia. This initiative by ZN DAO will drive increased adoption and awareness of ICP among a large and diverse group of developers, contributing to a more vibrant and expansive ecosystem. By introducing the ICP to a broad audience, the project ensures that more developers become proficient in using the protocol, which translates to a more robust and innovative ecosystem. 

Training a diverse group of developers will inject new perspectives and innovative solutions into the ICP ecosystem. This diversity fosters creativity and elevates the overall quality of projects developed on the platform. As developers are provided with comprehensive resources and support, the creation of new applications and services on the ICP will be stimulated, driving further innovation and expanding the capabilities of the ecosystem. 

Additionally, ZN DAO will focus on building a strong community of ICP developers who can collaborate, share knowledge, and support each other. This collaborative network will lead to faster problem-solving and more efficient development processes. By establishing this community in a significant tech hub like the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area, the project will enhance the credibility and reach of the ICP ecosystem, attracting more stakeholders and potential partners. 

The project will also generate valuable educational resources and best practices that can be shared with other communities worldwide, spreading knowledge and expertise about ICP globally. As more developers become skilled in using ICP, there will be an increased demand for related projects and services, which will drive job creation and economic growth within the local community and beyond. 

Leveraging the high-tech startup environment in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area, which is home to a significant number of tech entrepreneurs and web developers, ZN DAO will tap into this dynamic and innovative community. This will accelerate the growth and adoption of ICP, creating a thriving hub of cutting-edge blockchain and web3 development. Through these efforts, the "ICP in the DMV" project will not only strengthen the local tech scene but also contribute substantially to the global advancement of the ICP ecosystem. 

 

Increased Adoption and Awareness: By educating a large community of web developers in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area, ZN DAO will significantly boost awareness and adoption of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). More developers using ICP means a larger, more vibrant ecosystem. 

Diverse Talent Pool: Training a diverse group of developers will introduce new perspectives and innovative solutions to the ICP ecosystem, fostering creativity and enhancing the overall quality of projects developed on the platform. 

Enhanced Development and Innovation: Providing developers with comprehensive resources and support will lead to the creation of new applications and services on the ICP, driving innovation and expanding the ecosystem’s capabilities. 

Community Building and Collaboration: ZN DAO will create a strong community of ICP developers who can collaborate, share knowledge, and support each other. This network effect will lead to faster problem-solving and more efficient development processes. 

Increased Credibility and Reach: Establishing a robust developer community in a significant tech hub like the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area will enhance the credibility and reach of the ICP ecosystem, attracting more stakeholders and potential partners. 

Educational Resources and Best Practices: The project will develop educational materials and best practices that can be used by other communities, further spreading knowledge and expertise about ICP globally. 

Economic Growth and Job Creation: As more developers become proficient in ICP, the demand for related projects and services will increase, leading to job creation and economic growth within the local community and beyond. 

Leveraging a High-Tech Startup Environment: The DC, Maryland, and Virginia area is home to a high volume of tech startup entrepreneurs and web developers. By tapping into this dynamic and innovative community, ZN DAO will accelerate the growth and adoption of ICP, creating a thriving hub of cutting-edge blockchain and web3 development. 

 

 Implementation plan 

What is the implementation plan for the project? If the project entails building a course, please share topics that will be included in the content of the course and the target audience for the course. If the project entails organizing an event or creating content, please provide relevant details like the flow of the event/content, topics covered, and CTA. 

The first goal is to create software that can draw the masses from specific centralized services such as streaming. Netflix, Tubi, HBO Max, HULU are all major streaming platforms that command the attention of hundreds of millions of people. We think that if we can introduce easy-to-understand software to the market it will be easier to explain to newcomers and non-tech folk. If we can get a decentralized streaming service built on ICP to become a household name, then it will draw people of the other possibilities of the internet computer protocol. The second goal will be to bring awareness of the ICP to the Washington D.C, Maryland, Virginia, area aka the “DMV”. The DMV area has over 200,000 tech enthusiasts that do some sort of IT work that have never heard of the ICP and how it is easier than traditional Stack flow. 

The third goal is to attend this year's “Afro Tech” conference and give a presentation about ICP to the African American Tech sector of the USA. It will be held in Houston this year and attracts Web developers from all 50 states to one event out of the year.
